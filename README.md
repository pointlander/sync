# sync - Asynchronous neural networks

This is an experimental asynchronous neural network.

* Version 1 of the network is based on cellular automaton rule #110 with direct coupling.
* Version 2 of the network is based on harmonic oscillators coupled with asymmetric delay lines.

Learning is done with genetic optimization.
